Training the VGG16 model to detect pneumonia

Transfer learning was used to train the VGG16 model to detect pneumonia. The weights of the convolutional layers of the VGG16 model were first frozen. The final layer of the VGG16 model was then replaced by a new layer that can classify images of lungs into two categories (case where the patient has pneumonia and the case where the patient does not have pneumonia). The model was then trainied for 5 epochs (the model began overfitting the data set after 4 epochs.) The Pytorch deep learning framework was used. The estimated accuracy of the model on new data was 76.92% and the estimated f1 score was  0.8435. The f1 score was used to evaluate the model since the dataset is imbalanced. The code can be found in the Pneumonia_Detection.ipynb file.
